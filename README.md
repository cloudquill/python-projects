## Serverless Movies API
This serverless function provides a simple API for accessing movie information stored in a database. It includes several endpoints to retrieve a list of movies, filter movies by release year, and generate summaries for specific movies using AI.

## Weather App
The Weather app is a command-line application that allows you to easily retrieve weather information for any city around the world. Currently, it lets you check their current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
